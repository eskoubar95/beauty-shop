## Purpose
- Unified error/perf monitoring without PII; consistent release and sourcemaps.

## Org & projects
- SENTRY_ORG: `beauty-shop`
- Prefer per-app projects: `web`, `medusa`

## Releases & sourcemaps (example)
```
npx sentry-cli releases new "$GITHUB_SHA"
npx sentry-cli releases set-commits "$GITHUB_SHA" --auto
npx sentry-cli sourcemaps upload --org beauty-shop --project web .next/static --release "$GITHUB_SHA"
```

## Privacy
- Never send PII; mask sensitive fields; add `userId`, `release`, active flags as context.
