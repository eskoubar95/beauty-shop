## Naming
- `feature_<area>_<name>`; avoid generic names.

## Rollout
- Start with off-by-default; progressive rollout; define success/rollback.

## SDK usage
- Evaluate server-side for logic; client only for visual gating.

## DoD
- Named with `feature_<area>_<name>`; owner/TTL set; default OFF in prod.
- Server paths tested for ON/OFF; Sentry breadcrumb added; cleanup issue created.
