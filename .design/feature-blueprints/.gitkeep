# Feature Blueprints

Feature blueprints generated by `/feature-adapt-inspiration` command.

These are structured specifications created by reverse-engineering external systems using Playwright MCP.

## Structure

Each blueprint includes:
- Problem & value proposition
- Domain model (entities, relationships)
- Data model (fields, types, validations)
- User flows (step-by-step with edge cases)
- UX specifications
- Business logic & rules
- Implementation guide (Medusa/Strapi/Next.js)
- Risks, open questions, acceptance criteria

## Usage

Blueprints are starting points for:
1. `/research-feature-patterns` - Find similar internal patterns
2. `/create-implementation-plan` - Break down into phases
3. `/create-linear-issue` - Create ticket with blueprint

## Example

See example blueprint structure in `/feature-adapt-inspiration` command documentation.
